# Home Server
An in-home server used for toomanyprojects

## Setup
Run `yarn init-dev` to initialize the project

## Debug
In the root directory, run `yarn start`. This will start all of the docker containers in a debug state. I've provided a launch configuration for VSCode that will connect the VSCode debugger to the Docker instance running node.  Read the `node/README.md` file for details about running the watch process and tests.
